# McGill-ModelBasedProgramming-Project
Kingdomino Application Project for Model-Based Programming class at McGill university. 

## Iteration 1: Domain Model, Constraints, GUI Mockup
Create a domain model of the Kingdomino application with Umple that is sufficiently detailed to cover all features of the game (see a complete list of features in the Project Overview document already shared with you). The domain model must show all the concepts, their attributes, and their relationships in a UML Class Diagram documented in the wiki of your GitHub repository using the Markdown language. You do not need to show any operations in your domain model.

In the wiki of your GitHub repository, specify the 10 most important (interesting) constraints of the Kingdomino application, which are not covered by your domain model using a structured natural language. For navigation expressions, use the appropriate role names in your domain model precisely.
Create a project in Eclipse for your Kingdomino application. Place your Umple file in the root source folder of your project. Then, generate Java code from your domain model with Umple in the following package:
â€¢ ca.mcgill.ecse223.kingdomino.model
Commit your project including the Umple file and generated code to your repository in the GitHub organization of the course

As a team, create a UI mock-up including all features which are linked to the user interface (UI). State explicitly in your project report if a feature will not be available from the UI. While each team member will be responsible for the UI of her/his assigned features in Deliverable 4, but since the features need to be integrated into a common UI, this is a shared responsibility for Deliverable 1. As a team, you also need to ensure that the look and feel of the application is uniform across all features.
You may choose your favorite drawing tool for the UI mock-up or a UI prototyping tool such as Pencil (https://pencil.evolus.vn/) and then import the mock-up into your project report. You may also draw the UI mock-up by hand, scan it (or take a photo), and include it in your report as long as the mock-up is clearly legible. Your GUI mockups shall be documented as part of your project report of Deliverable 1 on the wiki page with a uniform look and formatting.
