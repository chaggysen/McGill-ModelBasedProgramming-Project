# McGill-ModelBasedProgramming-Project
Kingdomino Application Project for Model-Based Programming class at McGill university. 

## Iteration 1: Domain Model, Constraints, GUI Mockup
Create a domain model of the Kingdomino application with Umple that is sufficiently detailed to cover all features of the game (see a complete list of features in the Project Overview document already shared with you). The domain model must show all the concepts, their attributes, and their relationships in a UML Class Diagram documented in the wiki of your GitHub repository using the Markdown language. You do not need to show any operations in your domain model
